                <p class="text-muted">The school has three libraries (Junior, Middle and Senior) which are very well
                    stocked with more than 20835 books – fiction, non-fiction, autobiographies, biographies,
                    subject-related encyclopedias, etc. Students spend quality time undertaking reference work,
                    selecting their favourite author, browsing through new titles and updating themselves through a host
                    of journals and magazines covering commerce, finance, science, general knowledge, politics, nature,
                    art, sports and entertainment.
                    The senior library has been fully revamped with brand new furniture, computers for reference work
                    and has also been air-conditioned to provide children with a quiet and comfortable environment for
                    reference work.
                    A newly constructed air-conditioned Middle School library with aesthetic furniture is a favourite
                    place for the bookworms of the middle school.
                    To reach out to classrooms, the junior school has initiated classroom libraries for Classes I and II
                    which consist of fiction and non-fiction books. These libraries are utilised by students under the
                    supervision of the Class Teacher. This is in addition to the dedicated Junior School library.</p>
